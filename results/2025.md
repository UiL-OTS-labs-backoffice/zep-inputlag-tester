## Procedure

Follow instructions in README.md. I tried to hold the light sensor as close as possible to the centre of the monitors, but I didn't use a measuring tape or anything. Measurements were repeated a couple of time to eyeball-check for consistency.

I'm measuring time until first upward movement of the light sensor signal, and then the time it takes to reach 80% of the level at which the brightness flatlines.

V80% = MinV + 0.8 * (MaxV - MinV)

## Results

VSync is ON (VBLANK_MODE_DRM)

### B2283HS

Current standard lab monitor.

Displayport @ 1080p 60Hz

#### Centre

```
Time until first movement: 25ms
MinV: 0.08V
MaxV: 1.86V
V80%: 1.50V
T80%: 46ms
```

### XU2493HS

Displayport @ 1080p 100Hz


#### Centre

```
Time until first movement: 8.0ms
MinV: 0.08V
MaxV: 4.44V
V80%: 3.57V
T80%: 14ms
```

At 60Hz: Time until first movement goes up to 24ms, T80% = 30 ms



### XUB2492QSU

Displayport @ 1440p 100Hz

#### Centre

```
Time until first movement: 15ms
MinV: 0.08
MaxV: 3.66V
V80%: 2.94V
T80%: 20ms
```

At 60Hz: time until first movement goes up to 26ms, T80% is 32ms
