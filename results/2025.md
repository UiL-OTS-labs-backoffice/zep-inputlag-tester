* Procedure

Follow instructions in README.md. I tried to hold the light sensor as close as possible to the centre of the monitors, but I didn't use a measuring tape or anything.

I'm measuring time until first upward movement of the light sensor signal, and then the time it takes to reach 90% of the level at which the brightness flatlines.

V90% = MinV + 0.9 * (MaxV - MinV)

* Results

** E2283HS

Displayport @ 1080p 60Hz

*** Centre
Time until first movement: 18ms
MinV: 0.16V
MaxV: 1.84V
V90%: 1.512
T90%: 34ms


** XU2493HS

Displayport @ 1080p 100Hz


*** Centre
Time until first movement: 12ms
MinV: 0.10V
MaxV: 4.18V
V90%: 3.60V
T90%: 19ms

At 60Hz: Time until first movement goes up to 16ms, T90% = 24 ms



** XUB2492QSU

Displayport @ 1440p 100Hz

*** Centre
Time until first movement: 12ms
MinV: 0.10
MaxV: 3.64V
V90%: 3.186V
T90%: 20ms

At 60Hz: time until first movement goes up to 22ms, other timings similar
